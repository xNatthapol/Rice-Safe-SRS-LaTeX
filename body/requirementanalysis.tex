\subsection{Small-Scale Rice Farmers}
\label{subsection:small-scale-rice-farmers}

Small-scale rice farmers are the primary end users of the RiceSafe application. They face challenges in identifying and managing rice diseases in a timely and effective manner, often due to limited access to expert advice and resources. This app will empower them to quickly diagnose diseases using AI, receive treatment recommendations, and stay informed about disease outbreaks in their area. The application will be particularly beneficial for farmers who rely on personal experience rather than technical expertise, helping them reduce crop losses and improve yield through early detection and proper disease management.

\section{User Stories}
\label{section:user-stories}

\subsection{Rice Disease Detection}
\label{subsection:rice-disease-detection}

As a farmer, I want to upload images of my rice crops to get an accurate disease diagnosis, so that I can take timely action to prevent further crop damage.

\subsection{Treatment Recommendations}
\label{subsection:treatment-recommendations}

As a farmer, I want to receive treatment recommendations based on the disease identified, so I can apply the most effective solutions to protect my crops.

\subsection{Disease Library}
\label{subsection:disease-library}

As a farmer, I want to access a comprehensive library of rice diseases, their symptoms, causes, and treatments, so I can better understand and manage rice diseases.

\subsection{Outbreak Alerts}
\label{subsection:outbreak-alerts}

As a farmer, I want to receive alerts about potential disease outbreaks in my area, so I can take preventive measures before the disease spreads.

\subsection{Community Hub}
\label{subsection:community-hub}

As a farmer, I want to interact with a community of other farmers to share experiences and disease management tips, so I can improve my practices and learn from others.

\section{Use Case Diagram}
\label{section:use-case-diagram}
<TIP: Write a use case diagram for your project here. Refer to an
article “What is a use case diagram?” by Lucidchart for help./>

\section{Use Case Model}
\label{section:use-case-model}
A use case is a detailed description of how a system
interacts with an external entity (such as a user or another system) to
accomplish a specific goal. Use cases provide a high-level view of the
functionality of a system and help in capturing and documenting its
requirements from the perspective of end users.

<TIP: Write use cases for your project here. Make sure to use the
appropriate type of use case for each scenario (brief, casual, and fully-dressed
use case)./>

\section{User Interface Design}
\label{section:user-interface-design}
<TIP: Put the initial design of your application here. You can
showcase a detailed design of a specific page or a sitemap of your application.
See an example below./>
